Currently, I am working with my husband on a startup/incubator for audacious ideas, called Crazies & Co. Our biggest project is a holographic AI assistant ( https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sidekicks-co ).


My background includes roles as a web editor and content strategist with 12 years experience in the media industry. I would like to combine my journalistic digital skills with more technical ones through coding, and use those skills to further help in the startup and work in web development. 

My husband, who has a background in programming, also always tells me that my organizational mind and other traits would make me great in the field.
